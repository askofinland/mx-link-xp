NAME
       linux-desktop-maker - Create Linux .desktop launchers for Windows programs via MX·Link·XP

SYNOPSIS
       linux-desktop-maker.exe

DESCRIPTION
       linux-desktop-maker is a graphical utility for Windows XP that creates
       Linux-compatible .desktop launchers for Windows executables. These launchers
       are used in the MX·Link·XP environment to start Windows programs from a Linux desktop.

       It is part of the MX·Link·XP software package and requires no additional Linux
       configuration or Wine installation. All linking and launching are handled
       automatically through XP-side utilities.

USAGE
       1. Select a drive and folder where the Windows executable (.exe) resides.
       2. Choose an .exe file from the list.
       3. The icon is extracted and shown. The application name is determined
          automatically.
       4. Click "Make Desktop Shortcut" to:
            - Create an .ini launcher configuration in \MXP\ (MX·Link·XP Abbreviation: MXP)
            - Save an icon as .bmp in \MXP\
            - Generate a .desktop launcher content in the preview window
       5. You will be prompted to save the .desktop file to any location,
          including Linux Desktop folder (e.g. /home/user/Desktop).

FILES
       \MXP\[program].ini
              Contains launch parameters: exe name, path, system, and autostart flag.

       \MXP\[program].bmp
              Contains the extracted icon for the program.

       [chosen location]/[program].desktop
              The Linux launcher file, saved manually via a save dialog.

REQUIREMENTS
       - Windows XP inside Linux
       - COMDLG32.OCX installed and registered
       - Executables and related files accessible from XP

NOTES
       - All file paths inside the .desktop file are automatically converted to Linux format.
       - The iniwriter system will interpret the .ini and run the correct Windows program
         via MX·Link·XP automation.
